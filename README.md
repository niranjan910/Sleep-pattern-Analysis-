A data-driven project to analyze and predict student academic performance using Python, EDA, and Machine Learning.

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes BigBasket's sales data to uncover trends in customer purchasing behavior, popular product categories, seasonal demand patterns, and regional sales performance. Using data cleaning, exploratory analysis (EDA), and visualization, the goal is to derive actionable insights for optimizing inventory management, pricing strategies, and marketing campaigns. Predictive modeling may also be applied to forecast future sales trends.

## 🚀 Key Objectives:
- Identify best-selling products and high-demand categories.
- Analyze sales trends across different regions and time periods.
- Evaluate pricing and discount impacts on customer purchases.
- Provide data-driven recommendations to improve sales and customer retention.

## 🛠️ Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** (handling missing values, outliers)
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** (trends, correlations, statistical summaries)
- **Predictive Modeling** (grade prediction using regression/classification)
- **Interactive Visualizations** (matplotlib/seaborn)
- **Insightful Reports** (Jupyter Notebook)

## 📂 Dataset
